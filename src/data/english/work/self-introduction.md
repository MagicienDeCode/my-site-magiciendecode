# self-introduction 自我介绍

## 202406

- Hello everyone, my name is Li Xiang. I'm working as a Tech Lead at Slimpay. My role involves designing and developing new open banking products, guiding team members, and coaching new arrivals. I have more than 10 years of coding experience, including 6 years in the financial domain. Additionally, I have a solid background in SEPA payment solutions.

- I am applying for the Tech Mentor position because I enjoy sharing knowledge both at work and in life. I have solved more than 1,000 algorithm problems on LeetCode (I can share my screen to show this). Additionally, I have created around 550 videos to explain my ideas and code.


## Mention past experiences and proven successes that are related to the position

- situation -> task -> action -> result
- 【1. In my current role at XYZ Medical Center, the efficiency of the office has been a personal focus—especially as it relates to patient outcomes. I set and oversee goals related to department budget and patient volume. 】 Last year,
- 【2. I worked with our IT department to implement a communication system】
- 【3. for scheduling procedures and protocols to ensure that all departments were adequately staffed at all times.】
- 【4. With our new online scheduling portal, we increased communication efficiency by 20%. 】

- My name is Xiang LI.
- Working as a software engineer at Slimpay, the efficiency of solving problems has been a personal focus - especially as it relates to daily operational excellence and customer experience.
- I worked with our Payment Operation Analyst department to innovate a new project for handling balance problems and to ensure that daily reconciliation were resolved in time.
- With this new project, we save much time on daily balance problems, in general from 2h to 30mins.

## Consider how your current job relates to the job you're applying for

- To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular meetings with physicians, nurses and other healthcare staff. In my role, I also manage marketing and advertising efforts on behalf of the Center. I’ve been really enjoying that part of my work and I’m especially interested in bringing the experience I’ve gained as well as my commitment to efficiency to the team at ABC Health.

- To solve the daily balance problem, I investigated the job of reconciliation and discuss with payment analysts to establish a plan for the project. In my role, I especially checked into why the old algorithm takes much time and why sometimes it could not provide a solution. After that, I started a project in kotlin-javafx and it has been used by my team since March 2021. I got good feedback from my colleagues, even if I spent my leisure but it's joyful.

## Focus on strenghts and abilities that you can support with examples

## Highlight your personality to break the ice

- Outside of the office, I like cinema and hike. On weekends, you might find me at the cinema or exploring hiking trails in the area.
- I also like algorithm problems and I have resolved more than 700 problems on Leetcode.
